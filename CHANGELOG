SnapT v=0.3 (TBD)
	added expression curve analysis to remove lowly expressed transcripts
	increased minimum basepair coverage during transcript assembly from 2.5 to 10
	added -P option to specify minimum read coverage for transcript assembly
	increased hisat2 alignment requirements (much more strict)
	eliminated spliced alignment with hisat2
	major bug fix with faulty intercept with annotation
	added sorting of annotation as failsafe
	added test to see if ncRNAs have a ORF longer than 1/3 their length
	added NR protein database homology search with DIAMOND to remove proteins
	added Rfam homology search to remove irrelevant ncRNAs
	changed default minimum contig length (-l) to 3000

SnapT v=0.2 (February 2019)
	stringtie assembly is now guided
	added explicit genome indexing handling
	prokka is run if the user does not provide an annotation
	if there is a small peptide (<100nt) encoded in a much larger (3X) transcript, it can still be called a ncRNA
	non-coding transcripts need to overlap at least 10nt with opposite strand gene to be called antisense
	modified tip of contig thresholding to be more stringent
	added -l option to allow t specify smallest contig size
	snapt scripts are now dirrectly located in /bin/

SnapT v=0.1 (January 2019)
	Wrap sRNA discovery pipeline into usable wrapper
	First user-friendly version of SnapT
